The MARS software code contains an optional csv_generator function that allows for the user to upload a dataset and select up to five machine learning algorithms from the available seven options (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural Network, Custom). The function trains the algorithm(s), tests the algorithm(s), and outputs a .csv file ready for use in MARS ShineThrough and MARS Occlusion functions. The user could also upload their own .csv file, formatted as described at the beginning of section 2.1, directly to the MARS ShineThrough and MARS Occlusion functions. 
To use the csv_generator, follow the steps below: 
1.	Format your dataset such that the class label column is called ‘class_label’. Make sure the remaining columns all pertain to training data. Training data column names do not matter; radius_mean and texture_mean have been used as arbitrary examples of the training data columns in Fig. 4 below. You may use an alternative column names, and any number of columns, as your training data columns. Save the dataset as ‘data.csv’ in the same directory as the csv_generator function.


 
Fig. 4 Dataset formatting guide.

2.	Save a .txt file called ‘models.txt.’ in the same directory as the csv_generator function. The file should contain a list of at most 5 of the following classifier options:

a.	CNN – CNN
b.	 Decision Tree – DT 
c.	Logistic Regression – LR
d.	Naïve Bayes – NB
e.	 Random Forest – RF
f.	Support Vector Machine – SVM
g.	Custom , CustomNN, CustomCNN.
Models should be comma delimited and typed exactly as shown above in a.- f. after the dash.
